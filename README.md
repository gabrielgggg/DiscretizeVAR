# DiscretizeVAR
Discretize VAR(1) of arbitrary size, with arbitrary covariance matrix for innovations. Also, support for VAR(1) with covariance matrix perturbed by common AR(1) volatility shock, e.g. "volatility regime," like baseline Bansal-Yaron.

Uses the Armadillo library for C++, with HDF5 support.
